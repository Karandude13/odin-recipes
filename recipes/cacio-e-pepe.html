        <h3>Cacio-e-pepe is a pasta dish from the cuisine of the city of Rome</h3>
        <p>The pasta is prepared in boiling salted water as usual; it is then poured into the grated pecorino mixed with black pepper, with a little of the hot, starchy, cooking water. The heat melts the cheese, and the starches in the water help bind the pepper and cheese to the pasta.</p>
        <p>While not traditional to cacio e pepe, seafood or bacon may be added, and other shapes of pasta such as rigatoni, always made with a rough surface, may be used.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
