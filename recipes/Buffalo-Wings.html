        <h3>A Buffalo wing in American cuisine is an unbreaded chicken wing section (flat or drumette) that is generally deep-fried and then coated or dipped in a sauce consisting of a vinegar-based cayenne pepper hot sauce and melted butter prior to serving.</h3>
        <p>Buffalo wings have gained in popularity in the United States and abroad, with some North American restaurant chains featuring them as a main menu item. The name "Buffalo" is now also applied to other spiced fried foods served with dipping sauces, including boneless chicken wings (made from chicken breast meat), chicken fries, chicken nuggets, popcorn chicken, shrimp, and cauliflower.</p>
        <p>It also describes other dishes, such as pizza, that are seasoned with the Buffalo-style sauce or a Buffalo flavor seasoning.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 lb. chicken wings</li>
            <li>2 tbsp. vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 tsp. garlic powder</li>
            <li>Kosher salt</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 c. hot sauce</li>
            <li>2 tbsp. honey</li>
            <li>4 tbsp. butter</li>
            <li>Ranch dressing, for serving</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400° and place a wire rack over a baking sheet. In a large bowl, toss chicken wings with oil and season with garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Transfer to prepared baking sheet.</li><br>
            <li>Bake until chicken is golden and skin is crispy, 50 to 60 minutes, flipping the wings halfway through.</li><br>
            <li>In a small saucepan, whisk together hot sauce and honey. Bring to simmer then stir in butter. Cook until butter is melted and slightly reduced, about 2 minutes. Heat broiler on low. Transfer baked wings to a bowl and toss with buffalo sauce until completely coated. Return wings to rack and broil—watching carefully!—until sauce caramelizes, 3 minutes. Serve with ranch dressing and vegetables.</li>
        </ol>
